# 3chainz

Windows binary is located in 3chainz/bin. Snag 3chainz.exe and 3chainz.pck and ensure they are in the same directory. Execute 3chainz.exe.

Linux binary was compiled from Godot on Arch, and as such will run unreliably. If it doesn't run on your system, you likely need to import the project into Godot and export the project for your system. Same deal here- make sure 3chainz.x86_64 and 3chainz.pck are in the same directory, then fire up 3chainz.x86_64


### Controls: 

- A/D: Left and right, respectively
- S: Downward boost (when in air)/Chain Cancel
- W: Jump (to be removed, dependent on the "climb-up" mechanic being implemented.)
- Left Click: Attack (NON WORKING animation is working, collsision is not.)
- Right Click: Grappling Hook, targeting your mouse cursor. Collision with environment pulls you to target
