# 3chainz
3chainz. A game for the Godot Wild Jam #12. Happy codeversary! Made with Godot 3.1.1



Windows binary is located in 3chainz/bin. Snag 3chainz.exe and 3chainz.pck and ensure they are in the same directory. Execute 3chainz.exe.

Linux binary was compiled from Godot on Arch, and as such will run unreliably. If it doesn't run on your system, you likely need to import the project into Godot and export the project for your system. Same deal here- make sure 3chainz.x86_64 and 3chainz.pck are in the same directory, then fire up 3chainz.x86_64
